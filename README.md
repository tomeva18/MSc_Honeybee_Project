## Unravelling Genetic Determinants of Social and Private Information Use in Honeybees

### MSc_Honeybee_Project

For many organisms the genetic basis of behaviour is still barely understood. In the last decade, the 
introduction of highthroughput transcriptome sequencing enabled researchers to identify genes of 
which the degree of expression is associated with certain behavioural phenotypes. Behavioural 
variation associated with one of the most complex animal communication behaviours, the honey bee 
waggle dance, has previously been explored on a molecular level. Genes have been found that may 
underpin the propensity of individuals to show interest in the information relayed by the honeybee 
waggle dance. The aim of this project is to dive deeper in the transcriptomic information at hand, 
and to assess whether genetic differences among honeybees are linked to the observed behavioural 
variation in dance following. This project will involve learning how to use variant calling software, a 
methodology which is applicable to many research fields in biology and medicine.

Data for this study is from [Kennedy et al. (2021)]([url](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.15893)). 
All sequencing data has been deposited in the Sequencing Read Archive (SRA: PRJNA707149) of 
the NCBI.
